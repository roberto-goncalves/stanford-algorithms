This repository have the objetive to explain some classes/algorithms from: 

_StanfordOnline: CSX0003 Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1_

[Course link](https://www.edx.org/course/algorithms-design-and-analysis)

	1. mergesort: In a simple way, it is a Divide and Conquer algorithm to order a array with N elements. It has time complexity of O(n * log2 n)
                     because we have to do 2 divisions at each level of the recursion tree (see the algorithm) and then we take n times to merge the array.
