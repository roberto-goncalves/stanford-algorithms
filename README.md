This repository have the objetive to explain some classes from StanfordOnline: CSX0003 Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1 

	* mergesort: Is a simple way it is a Divide and Conquer algorithm to order a array with N elements. It has time complexity of O(n * log2 n)
                     because we have to do 2 divisions at each level of the recursion tree and then we take n time to order the array.
